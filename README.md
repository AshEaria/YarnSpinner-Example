# YarnSpinner-Example
*Introduction to using YarnSpinner tool in Unity*

## Introduction
This project is companion to YouTube tutorial for using YarnSpinner with Unity.

## Requirements
* Unity 2019.3 or later is prefered, as you can install the YarnSpinner tool directly from Package Manager
* VS-Code, while not essential - is nice for editing the yarn files with syntax highlighting
