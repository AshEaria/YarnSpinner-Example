# YarnSpinner-Example
*Introduction to using YarnSpinner tool in Unity*

## Introduction
This project is companion to [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/CJu0ObGDQHY) for using YarnSpinner with Unity.  The default branch is the base project to follow along with, there are two other branches for incremental stages through the tutorial.

## Requirements
* Unity 2019.3 or later is prefered, as you can install the YarnSpinner tool directly from Package Manager
* VS-Code, while not essential - is nice for editing the yarn files with syntax highlighting
